Globus is a fast, reliable file transfer service that makes it easy for users to move data between two GridFTP servers or between a GridFTP server and a user’s machine (Windows, Mac or Linux). <br>
Globus automates the activity of managing file transfers: monitoring performance, retrying failed transfers, recovering from faults automatically whenever possible, and reporting status. <br>

Steps for users wanting to transfer files between hosts configured for Globus access:

Sign in to Globus using your Globus username and password.

The panels button help us split the screen and we can view two collections side by side.

We can see the screen splits after a user toggles to the split view

We can search the desired end points from the “collection” search bar.

After desired endpoints are selected, Path can be set in the path field. Here in the below screenshot the left side, endpoint (koundinya_challa) is a personal endpoint on a laptop and on the right side, endpoint (UNCG Computer Science) is an institutional endpoint.

You can similarly, send an entire directory from one endpoint to another. In the example below, the directory Globus_playground is selected to be sent. The same steps can be repeated to send an entire directory.
